Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------

To install the module, download the module's tar file, extract to your project root folder, sibling to cms and sapphire.

Usage Overview
-----------------------------------------------
GenericDataAdmin is an abstract class for building custom interfaces, with built-in search- and edit-functionality.

The interface is mostly tailored around a single type of DataObject (e.g. News for the subclass your NewsAdmin).

The customization is achieved by overriding a few context-specific methods (e.g. performSearch() and save()) and using Silverstripeâ€™s sophisticated form-generation.

GenericDataAdmin builds on the basic CMS-interface (class LeftAndMain), so you can also use this class to generate trees etc.

Up to SilverStripe 2.3, there are a bunch of solid admins depending on this abstract admin:

Known issues
-----------------------------------------------
'genericdataadmin' will be deprecated starting from 2.3 in favor of ModelAdmin, no further development needed.
Historically, it does bring lots of interesting issues as following:

1. Validation to GenericDataAdmin forms: fixed by the adding specific function to the data object it manages: getCMSRequiredField(). No particular ticket is created for this, but a changset #40754 (http://open.silverstripe.com/changeset/40754) address this.
2. It is not scrollable and not resizable in IE for the search results pane: its is fixed by css and update the search result holder with fitToParent function in front end in JS.
3. Stabilizing GenericDataAdmin search result export function, allowing for multiple GDA search buttons: done by checking if the posted csvIDs is set, calling the button's name rather than hard-coded 'action_getResults', etc. Changeset #57276 (http://open.silverstripe.com/changeset/57276)
